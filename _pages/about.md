## Education

- **PhD in Electrical Engineering**  
I specialized in pattern recognition and statistical learning. I did quite a bit of work deriving and implementing algorithms for detailed deformable shape detection and object recognition. I also collaborated with cognitive scientists and started learning about category learning. I developed <a href="https://github.com/sriveravi/GVSToolbox">tools</a> that apply pattern recognition methods to gaze data.  

- **Postdoctoral Researcher in Cognitive Science**  
I took my collaborations to the next level and did a few years in a cognitive development lab. That's where I started mentoring undergrads and teaching them how to use python and git. I also did a bunch of eye-tracking, EEG, and behavioral studies with students, children, and infants. We tried to understand the mechanisms underlying concept and category learning over development.

## Experience

- **Research Engineer**  
    - I read the papers, derive the algorithms, and write the code.  
    - I run the experiments, make the reports, and write the papers.  
    - Now and then I mentor an intern or lead a research project.  

## Hobbies

Cycling when warm; Snowboarding when cold; Videogames with my dog; Toy projects now and then.
